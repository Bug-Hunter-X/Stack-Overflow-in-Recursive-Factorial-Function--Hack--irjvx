# Stack Overflow in Recursive Factorial Function (Hack)

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: stack overflow. The `foo` function calculates the factorial recursively.  While functional for small inputs,  it crashes for larger numbers due to exceeding the call stack limit. The solution provides an iterative approach to avoid this issue.
